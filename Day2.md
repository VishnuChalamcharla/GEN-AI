# Neural Networks in LLMs (Simple Guide)

## What is a Neural Network?
A neural network is a system inspired by the human brain that learns patterns from data using artificial neurons (nodes).

In Large Language Models (LLMs), neural networks help the model:
- Understand language
- Learn relationships between words
- Predict the next word (token)

---

## Why Neural Networks Are Used in LLMs
- Language is complex and pattern-based
- Neural networks learn from massive text data
- They improve predictions by learning from mistakes

---

## Types of Neural Networks

### 1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
**Description:**
- Basic neural network structure
- Includes input, hidden, and output layers

**Used for:**
- Simple classification and prediction tasks

**Example:**
- Spam email detection
- Exam score prediction

---

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
**Description:**
- Designed for image and visual data
- Detects patterns like edges and shapes

**Used for:**
- Image recognition
- Face detection

**Note:**
- Not used in LLMs

---

### 3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
**Description:**
- Handles sequential data
- Remembers previous inputs

**Used for:**
- Early NLP and speech models

**Limitation:**
- Struggles with long context

# Tokens and Transformers in LLMs (Simple Guide)

## What is a Token?
A token is the **smallest unit of text** that a Large Language Model (LLM) understands and processes.

Tokens can be:
- A word
- Part of a word
- A character or symbol


## Why Tokens Are Important
- LLMs do not understand full sentences directly
- All text is converted into tokens first
- Cost, speed, and limits of LLMs depend on token count

---

## Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of **breaking text into tokens** before processing.
## What is a Transformer?
A Transformer is the **core neural network architecture** used in modern LLMs.

> GPT = Generative Pre-trained Transformer

Transformers process **all tokens in parallel**, unlike older models.

---

## Why Transformers Are Powerful
- Understand long sentences and documents
- Capture relationships between words
- Faster training and inference
- Highly scalable
